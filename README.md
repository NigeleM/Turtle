# Turtle Is Under Update and rewriting
Turtle Programming Language
# Where I am Currently
1. Re-writing interpreter in go
2. Output establsihed
3. Variable and non variable expressions can be evaluated
4. Display different data to the screen.
5. define and call functions , Function expressions can be evaluated with implementation of return functions 
6. if else statements implemented (nested functionality as well)
7. For and conditional loops implemented (nested functionality as well) 
8. See Issues tab for upcoming updates


# The Turtle Programming Language â“’ 2017
Turtle was my side project during community college and university. 
It is copyrighted by me. My goal was to make a very simple language
that could be made a universal language and shift some of the coding paradigms
used in the industry. Being that i had limited knowledge on how to write an interpreter 
and compiler it has taken a while to complete. I was able to actually write an interpreter in python 
but it wasn't independent of python. I ended up re-writing it in C, but i may have to start writing it in C#.
I had attempted to re-write in Java but it would be dependent on Java. I also wanted it to be very fast so C was a better option.
My knowledge of C is limited as well, when it comes to memory allocation. My language has some of the basics but needs some help in
memory allocation to help with developing objects and recursive functions.

# Current Update as of 2023
Currently I am rewriting the Turtle interpreter in GO (Golang)
Once I am able to publish a stable release I will make available for use and consumption.
I'm working currently to add all the basics of a language before writing a standard library.
The goal of this project or language is to be able to write simplified and easy statement with very
few key strokes. Later this year I will add offical Documentation in order to explain how everything works.
