Currently I am rewriting the Turtle interpreter in GO (Golang)
Once I am able to publish a stable release I will make available for use and consumption.
I'm working currently to add all the basics of a language before writing a standard library.
Later this year I will add offical Documentation in order to explain how everything works.
