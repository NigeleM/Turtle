implemented - for void and returning functions - incorporate functions into show
fixed - % note : you can't do multiple show arguments with functions 
fixed - variable expression show functionality 
fixed - fixing show variable issues. 
implemented - nested logic for if else statements
% note : nested loops can't be called recursive , need to further enhance nested ability 
implemented - nested variable parser
implemented - parser for loops 
working - implementation of using the counter in the loop
implemented - context variable management for loops and if else statement
working - check for errors all through code
working - while loop structure add
implemented - add more show functionality
50 % working -  add to if else parser return function capability for variables 
% note : further context is needed for function implementation
working -  add to loop parser return function capability for variables
